Academic – Data Science Project:

 ● 	Asteroid Classification for Near-Earth Objects (Hazardous and Non-Hazardous) 
Business Objective: To identify hazardous near-Earth objects. 
Approach: Exploratory Data Analysis was done to identify patterns and trends which contribute towards a near- Earth object being hazardous. Further Machine Learning algorithms were used to predict whether an object is hazardous or not. The final model used was the Lightgbm framework. 
Tools Used: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sci-Kit Learn
